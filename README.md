# Durandal_Papers
My personal notes about web security. Project based in a 30 week certification course.__

All contents described here were based in Port-swigger training for Burp certification.__
Again, it's my personal notes written in Brazilian Portuguese. The main object here are to abate access to good learning material for Brazilian students, in case, computer science students at UNB (Universidade de Bras√≠lia).__
Don't worry ! I've already hired a friend to write all the contents in a '.txt' form, when it will be done ? Who knows ?! Hehe.__
